HOW TO RUN THE PLUGIN FROM SAP WEB IDE
======================================
1. In SAP Web IDE, right-click on "Component.js"
2. Choose "Run" > "Run Configurations" 
3. In the dialog create a new configuration from "SAP Fiori Launchpad on Sandbox"
4. As a file to run choose "/fioriSandboxConfig.json"
5. In the tab "URL Components" enter #Shell-home as URL Hash Fragment
6. Press "Save and Run"

As a result, the SAP Fiori launchpad opens in a new tab.
In the URL, the "sap-ushell-sandbox-config" parameter is
set in order to load the file "fioriSandboxConfig.json"
as the launchpad configuration file.

The file "fioriSandboxConfig.json" is part of the plugin
project and configures the launchpad to load and use the
plugin. In production fioriSandboxConfig.json may not be
needed. This depends on how the plugin is configured to
be used by SAP Fiori launchpad. For more information, see
